summary: "Assessing the awareness and willingness among young people in Sweden, including students at Södertörn University, to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection originated in the 20th century and has existed for more than 40 years. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) approved a new treatment to prevent HIV infection called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). It is up to 90% effective. PrEP is a medication used by people at high risk or who feel they are at risk for HIV infection. PrEP was widely implemented worldwide in 2015 and has been developed to include multiple modes of use, such as oral tablets or monthly injections. Sweden introduced PrEP relatively early. However, it was not until 2017 that PrEP was included in the national treatment and prescription system. The PrEP program in Sweden is limited to groups identified as at high risk of HIV infection. Even then, there was only one clinic that provided PrEP treatment in each region in Sweden. The communication and treatment provision for people in need of PrEP has also been delayed in Sweden amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focuses on determining the knowledge and willingness to use PrEP among young people in Sweden in general and among students at Södertörn University. Data was collected using an anonymous online questionnaire, in cooperation with the NGO RFSL."
