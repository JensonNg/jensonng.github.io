summary: "The study has built up a set of hydrodynamic models for storm surge simulation in the coastal area of Thua Thien Hue province with different storm scenarios to determine the value of storm surge caused by extreme storms. The study has proposed the storm scenarios: Scenario 1: Hydraulic simulation of the study area when there is no storm, the period September 25, 2009 - September 29, 2009| Scenario 2: Ketsana storm simulation. Time September 25, 2009 - September 29, 2009| Scenario 3: Adjusting the direction of Hurricane Ketsana| Scenario 4: Typhoon Ketsana's landing time change coincides with storm surge combined with adjusted storm movement direction| Scenario 5: Storm simulation according to MONRE scenario with the direction of the storm movement adjusted and the landing time coinciding with high tide. Simulation results of the scenarios show that research had indicated the influence factors of time, the path of the storm as well as the tide on the storm surge value."
