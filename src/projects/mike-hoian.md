summary: "The thesis has built up the MIKE 21 model data set in simulating the hydraulic mode, wave and sediment transport with a reliable Nash coefficient 0.88. Thereby simulating the following sets of scenarios: Scenario 1 simulates sediment transport without embankments; Scenario 2 simulates sediment transport when embankment L1 = 300m and Scenario 3 simulates sediment transport with embankment L2 = 150m. The simulation results show that the flow trend and sediment transport process due to longshore currents, during the northeast monsoon, the sediment is concentrated in the left side of the groynes embankments. In contrast, during the southwest monsoon period, the sediment accumulates on the right side of the groynes. The simulating sediment process transport in the study area according to the scenarios to evaluate the sediment transport when passing through the groin embankments, thereby comparing the effect of the groyne embankment length on this process. The results of hydraulic simulation and sediment transport, we find that with the groin embankment length L1 is more effective than the embankment length L2 in retaining sediment and increasing sediment in the embankment area."
