summary: "Hej! I'm Nguyễn Ngọc Sơn (a.k.a. Jenson), welcome to my blog! As a dynamic environmental activist who focuses on social communication and waste management, I have been working for more than three years for local and international non-profit organisations in Vietnam. For me, communication is a rope connecting people, spreading positive emotions. Protecting the environment is not just protecting the planet, it is saving our lives, our next generation!"
